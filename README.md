# React Router Apple Nav

* Now that you have played around with Routing and building out some nested routes etc. It's time to get you into a little more practice. Remember that repetition is key.
* The idea here is to build out a replica of Apple's navigation.
* Add a menu similar to the one on https://www.apple.com with a top level navigation.

## Project

* Use _create-react-app_ to make an application, name it `apple-nav`.
* You'll need to build out a few components here. Some variation of a `NavWrapper` component which will be your navigation header.
* You'll need a reusable `Nav` component that you can turn into a navigation link for each parent category.
* Lastly you're going to need some sort of `SubNav` component, that will be reusable and display your sub-navigation links for each category.

## Stretch Problem

* Research CSSTransition

This example shows the sub-navigation for the `/mac` route.
